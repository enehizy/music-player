### Tailwind CSS Integration

	•	Added Tailwind Directives: Tailwind CSS directives have been added to the index.css file to streamline styling and utilize utility-first CSS classes for faster and more efficient design.
	•	Removed App.css: The App.css file has been deleted to avoid conflicts and redundant styling since Tailwind CSS now handles all styling needs.
